<!-- Below you will find an example of a project object.
Below does not include all the properties of a project object. It only includes the properties
that are required to compute the budget.

The below intends to describe a bit of the business logic behind the project, so that you are able to better
understand the app.

The project object represents a program that we offer to the client.
The Program is usually a conference or an incentive trip
that the client is planning.

They usually stay for 2 or 3 days. On Arrival day, the agency meets them at the airport, they take them to the chosen hotel
by bus, or individual cars, and then they may do an offsite dinner on arrival day
On day 2, they may have a meeting in the morning, lunch in the hotel, an activity in the afternoon ....

The app offers them sample programs and diferent alternatives for each day.

			//If it's empty, it means that we are not offering any hotel to this group. Maybe the client
			//has contracted the hotel themselves

			breakfast: Number,
				//This amount is usually 0, since breakfast is usually included in the Hotel rate
				//If it's not 0, then the amount should be added to the price.
